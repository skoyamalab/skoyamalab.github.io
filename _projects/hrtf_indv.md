The head-related transfer function (HRTF) describes how sound propagates from a source to both ears. It contains important information for human sound localization and is essential for achieving binaural reproduction, a spatial audio technology for headphones. However, HRTFs vary significantly among listeners, and using another person's HRTF for binaural signals often results in localization errors. Therefore, to achieve high-quality binaural reproduction, it is crucial to obtain an individual's HRTF using a simple setup. We are investigating techniques such as upsampling HRTFs from a small set of measurements and estimating an individual's HRTF from ear shape parameters using machine learning.
