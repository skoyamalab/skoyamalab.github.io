Active noise control (ANC) is a technique to reduce noise by a canceling loudspeaker and monitoring microphone, which has been applied to local or one-dimensional space such as earphones and air ducts. Spatial ANC aims to reduce noise over a three-dimensional target region. However, conventional techniques can reduce noise only at microphone positions. We develop a new spatial ANC technique to reduce regional noise by estimating a noise field with microphones and synthesizing an anti-noise field with loudspeakers.
