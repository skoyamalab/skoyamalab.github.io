Since conventional stereophonic / surround sound systems are based on an auditory property called summing localization, their appropriate listening position is limited to the center of loudspeakers, the so-called sweet spot. Furthermore, especially when reproducing reverberant sounds, the driving signals of the loudspeakers are manually designed by sound engineers. 
Sound field reproduction techniques aim to synthesize physical acoustic fields, enabling a broad listening area and sound distance and reverberation reproduction without designing processes.
