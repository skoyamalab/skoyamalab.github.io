### Research topics

Our main research topic is the analysis and control of acoustic fields and their applications. In particular, we explore new signal processing/machine learning methodologies that incorporate the physical properties of wave fields. Based on these methodologies, we aim to develop systems for virtual/augmented reality audio, noise control, acoustic imaging, and others.
