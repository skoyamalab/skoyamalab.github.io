[MEXT Scholarship](https://www.nii.ac.jp/graduate/en/entrance/) is also an option for international students. We also provide strong support for applications to the [JSPS Research Fellowship (DC)](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/) and other fellowships.
- <b>Research Environment</b>: With a low student-to-faculty ratio, we provide close mentoring and high-quality research guidance tailored to each research phase. Students also have full access to high-performance computers and professional acoustic measurement facilities.
- <b>Career Path</b>: Our research covers everything from fundamental theory to social implementation, preparing our graduates for careers in both academia and global industry leaders.
- <b>Working Professionals</b>: We offer flexible research scheduling for working professionals who wish to pursue a Ph.D. while maintaining their careers.
